# CrossingHunter
A lightweight, efficient library for detecting intersections between complex multi-valued curves. Designed for high performance: curve segmentation, interpolation, and precise root-finding through adaptive bisection.



**CrossingHunter** is a lightweight and efficient Python library for detecting intersections between complex, multi-valued curves.  
It is designed to handle high-precision tasks where traditional root-finding methods fail due to curve complexity or non-monotonicity.

Key features:
- **Curve Segmentation**: Automatically segments curves into monotonic parts for reliable interpolation.
- **High Precision**: Adaptive bisection method ensures sub-pixel level intersection accuracy.
- **One-to-Many Support**: Quickly find intersections between a fixed curve and multiple target curves without redundant computation.
- **Flexible and Modular**: Easy to integrate into larger projects.
